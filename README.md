# Newspaper-Blog-website
A newspaper website with a landing page (home), news, about and contact pages accessible in the nav-bar.  The 'about' page contains brief information about myself. On the 'contact' page, there is a message box to take message inputs after which you must have provided your full-name and email address. Below this are my linkedIn, twitter and github profile links, click on them to access my profile.  Also, I made a 'compose' page on the backend in order to render latest news to the 'news' page. Check it out: https://lnkd.in/exi4Mye5 Frontend: html, css, javascript, embedded javascript (ejs) Backend: node.js, mongoDB Atlas. Server: aws, heroku.
